# Glowing Brew

Glowing brew is a homebrew tap inspired by [Aur](https://aur.archlinux.org). It (will) contains my favorite apps, my projects and packages for [Spacefin](https://github.com/ExistingPerson08/Spacefin). It should support both Linux and MacOS, but only Linux is tested and supported. If you want to add app, you can make PR. If you want to see any app here, create an issue and add [APP REQUEST] before name.

## Add this tap

To add this tap, run this command in your terminal.

```bash
brew tap existingperson08/tap
```
